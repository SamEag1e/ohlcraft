# OHLCraft

A Pythonic framework-in-the-making for automating trading strategies with clarity, reusability, and modularity.

---

## What is this?

OHLCraft is a passion project aimed at solving a common problem: how to automate and structure trading strategies in Python, without falling back to rigid or obscure platforms like MQL or Pine Script.

It‚Äôs not a mature or production-grade framework‚Äîyet. It‚Äôs a growing toolkit, shaped by real-world needs, actual bots, and the developer‚Äôs curiosity to craft something useful and extensible.

## Why I‚Äôm building this

After working on a few trading automation projects for clients and building custom bots, I kept noticing a gap:

Most solutions are either too abstract, too specific, or simply not Pythonic enough.

So this is my attempt to start a flexible and clean framework:

- Modular components (like Candle, Bot, Data, Notification)
- Pluggable strategies and job handlers
- Configurable logging, alerts, and backtesting flows
- Centered around OHLC logic (no realtime tick spam‚Ä¶ for now)

## The vision

This isn't about reinventing the wheel‚Äîit's about crafting a toolkit for others like me:

People who want to build bots with Python, reason about strategies with clarity, and avoid starting from scratch every time.

This is the v0.0.x era of the framework. I‚Äôm focusing on core design, extensibility, and DX (developer experience).

OHLCraft is not a polished product‚Äîyet. It's a sandbox, an evolving ecosystem, and a side project I'm excited to grow into something meaningful.
